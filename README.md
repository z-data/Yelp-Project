US local businesses are some of the hardest-hit industries in the COVID-19 pandemic. Many large businesses are able to wait out the pandemic until they are able to reopen stores to the public again. Small businesses, however, do not have this luxury. In this paper, we look to get a base level understanding of how hard US businesses were hit and generate a model that predicts which features would most likely keep the business open.  This leads us to conclusions that to help local businesses customers should rate and review the places that they like, and businesses should push for the customers to do so.
